The main advantage of the following project was to get a hand on experience of the entire process of deep learning, from the raw files itself to generating a dataset. Transforming a raw dataset to a reliable working data loader, designing an architecture that can learn and predict from it.

The purpose of the project was above all to learn as much as possible and to get a real feeling of the preprocessing phase, which most of the time is “lost” during the courses of AI and DL. The initial intentions of the project were to design a smart home system that could predict many things, such as when to turn on the refrigerator or when to turn the alarm system of the house automatically.
